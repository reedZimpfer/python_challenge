#Reed Zimpfer
#Module 3 - Python Challenge

I really enjoyed this challenge as there were multiple ways to go about it and I found a uniform way that I will definitely be able to apply in the future.


PyBank:
    In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv, which is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

    I have created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

        1) The total number of months included in the dataset.

        2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

        3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.

        4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

        5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


PyPoll: 
    In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv, which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

    I have created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

        1) The total number of votes cast.

        2) A complete list of candidates who received votes.

        3) The percentage of votes each candidate won.

        4) The total number of votes each candidate won.

        5) The winner of the election based on popular vote.


The results for both PyBank and PyPoll are displayed both on the terminal and written to their own output text files in their respective analysis folders. I have commented out some print statements I was using for testing.
